This directory contains all classes and files needed to 
implement the fourth iteration of the MiniDraw Case
Study.  In this prototype, the text tool is very 
primitive--just basic functionality to illustrate
the design concept.  Filled shapes have not been
implemented but this is fairly trivial.

A tar ball is provided that contains all of the 
files for simplified download.

Note that in this iteration the ToolBarView has been
implemented using a JToolBar rather than a Box.
